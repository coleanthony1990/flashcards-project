## Introduction

I , [Cole Anthony](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cole-edwin-anthony/) wrote this game of flashcards that uses questions about Javascript and is meant to be played in the terminal. The game can be cloned here: https://github.com/coleanthony1990/flashcards-project.git

## Playing Flashcards
After initializing the game with the commend `node index.js`, the player is given a question with a set of possible answers and the player must choose the right one by it's index value. the game will tell you if your choice is correct or incorrect and it will give you a score at the end of the game.

## Future Additions
I would like to add a timer in the future as well as a report card and more questions or different questions.
## Reflections
I found that writing tests came pretty quickly but figuring out what to test for was more difficult. Writing the tests definitely helped me write more efficient code because I was only trying to write code to pass the tests.
## Project Spec
The project spec and rubric is linked [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/flash-cards.html).
